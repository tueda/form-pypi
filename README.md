FORM
====

FORM is a Symbolic Manipulation System. It reads symbolic expressions from files and executes symbolic/algebraic transformations upon them. The answers are returned in a textual mathematical representation. As its landmark feature, the size of the considered expressions in FORM is only limited by the available disk space and not by the available RAM. FORM has been essential for many state-of-the-art computations in High Energy Physics.

FORM's original author is Jos Vermaseren of NIKHEF, the Dutch institute for subatomic physics. Other people that have made contributions can be found in the file "[AUTHORS](https://github.com/form-dev/form/blob/master/AUTHORS)".

Quick examples
--------------

The following FORM program repeatedly matches the power of a variable `x` in the expression `E`, as long as the power is more than 1 and creates two new terms with lower power:

```form
Symbol x,n;
Local E = x^10;

repeat id x^n?{>1} = x^(n-1) + x^(n-2);

Print;
.end
```

and yields `E = 34 + 55*x`.

The following FORM program matches the function `f` that has any arguments before encountering an `x` and any arguments after, and switches them around:

```form
CFunction f;
Symbol x;
Local E = f(1,2,x,3,4);

id f(?a,x,?b) = f(?b,?a);

Print;
.end
```

and yields `E = f(3,4,1,2)`.

FORM can match many more complicated patterns and has many more features, as documented in the [additional information](#additional-information).
